/**
 * GET  /api/v1/items/[id]/comments — the listing's comments, newest first.
 * POST /api/v1/items/[id]/comments — add one.
 *
 * ── NEWEST FIRST, and it is a choice ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * /api/posts/[id]/comments sorts ASCENDING and pages with a Prisma `cursor` +
 * `skip: 1`, which is offset pagination wearing a keyset's clothes: it re-reads
 * the boundary row on every page and drifts the moment a comment is added or
 * deleted mid-scroll. This sorts descending on (createdAt, id) and pages with
 * the shared keyset helpers, like every other v1 list.
 *
 * Descending is also the right answer for what this list IS. A listing's
 * comments are mostly questions — is this still available, will you take X —
 * and the useful one is the last one, not the first. A chat transcript reads
 * oldest-first; a queue of questions does not.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS NOT HERE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * REPLIES ARE COUNTED, NOT RETURNED. `replyCount` rides on each row so a thread
 * view has its number the day it exists; the replies themselves are a nested
 * unbounded read on every page and there is no screen for them. POST accepts a
 * `parentId`, so writing a reply is possible before reading one is — that
 * asymmetry is deliberate, and it is the cheap half.
 *
 * COMMENT LIKES ARE ABSENT ENTIRELY. CommentLike exists and the legacy route
 * returns `likeCount`/`liked` for every comment and every reply. There is no v1
 * endpoint to act on them, and shipping a count with no way to change it is the
 * dead affordance this whole task exists to remove. When the endpoint lands the
 * fields land with it.
 *
 * ── BLOCKING ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Filtered on the AUTHOR as well as on the listing. A listing you can see may
 * still carry comments from someone you have blocked, and the query layer is
 * where that has to be handled — see @/lib/blocking for why never fetching them
 * is different from fetching and hiding them. The count in `stats.comments`,
 * which comes off the item's `_count`, is NOT filtered this way and will read
 * high for a viewer with blocks. That is a known and accepted divergence: the
 * alternative is a per-viewer counting query on every feed card.
