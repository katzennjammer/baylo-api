/**
 * GET /api/v1/items/[id] — item detail, plus everything the viewer needs to
 * make an offer without a second request.
 *
 * FIVE queries, not the three the shapes proposed. The proposal counted "pickup
 * access plus any existing offer" as one step — they are two different tables —
 * and it did not account for the viewer's Leaf balance, which the offer sheet
 * needs. Four of the five run concurrently, so it costs two round trips of
 * latency, but it is five queries and this comment is not going to call it three.
 *
 *   1  item with owner
 *   2  pickup access
 *   3  any existing pending offer from this viewer
 *   4  the viewer's tradeable items, for the offer sheet's picker
 *   5  the viewer's Leaf balance
 *   6  the owner's trust tier (three aggregates, inside loadEffectiveTiers)
 *
 * ON (6), ADDED FOR THE ITEM DETAIL SCREEN. This route used to send
 * `owner.trustTier: null` — the field existed and was never populated, because
 * resolving it costs three aggregates and no screen drew the badge. The mobile
 * detail screen does, and this is the one screen where the badge earns those
 * queries: it is where somebody decides whether to go and meet a stranger.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT THE CLIENT-SIDE FALLBACK. `resolveTier()` in the app can
 * derive a tier from `totalTrades` and `rating` without a round trip, and its
 * own comment says it reads high — it works off a denormalised counter that has
 * drifted above the real completed count, and it cannot see DPA defaults at
 * all. An inflated trust badge is worse than no badge on this screen, so the
 * server answers or nobody does.
 *
 * One owner, so the aggregates are over a single id and this is cheap. It runs
 * in the same Promise.all as 2-5 and costs no extra round trip of latency.
 *
 * 404 rather than 403 for a REMOVED item or one the viewer may not read. A 403
 * confirms the row exists, and a hidden listing should not confirm it exists —
 * this matches what the current /api/items/[id] already does.
