/**
 * POST   /api/v1/items/[id]/like — like this listing.
 * DELETE /api/v1/items/[id]/like — unlike it.
 *
 * TWO METHODS, NOT ONE TOGGLE. /api/posts/[id]/like is a toggle, and a toggle
 * is the wrong shape for a control that fires from a tap on a moving list:
 * the client cannot tell a lost response from a second like, so a retry after a
 * timeout UNLIKES. Both of these are idempotent — POST twice is one like,
 * DELETE twice is no like — so the client may retry either one freely, which is
 * what makes the optimistic heart in the feed safe.
 *
 * WHY THIS ROUTE EXISTS AT ALL, given /api/posts/[id]/like already works: that
 * route answers `{ liked, count }`, a bare body outside the envelope, and it
 * does not check `visibleItemWhere`, so a listing you cannot see is still a
 * listing you can like. Both are fixed here rather than there — the legacy
 * route is the web's and is left alone.
 *
 * BOTH ANSWER WITH THE WHOLE `stats` BLOCK, in the same shape the feed sent it
 * (v1Stats, the same function v1Item uses). The client applies its optimistic
 * change, and on the response replaces its guess with the truth — including the
 * comment count, which it did not ask about but which may well have moved since
 * the page was fetched. A response of `{ liked: true }` would leave the count
 * to be inferred, and inference is how two clients end up disagreeing about a
 * number they both received.
 *
 * `postId` is the column name; the row is an Item. See the PostLike model —
 * "post" is what listings were called before they were listings.
