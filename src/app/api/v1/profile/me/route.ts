/**
 * GET /api/v1/profile/me — the shelf and profile screens, folded into one.
 *
 * SIX queries, not the five the shapes proposed. The proposal folded every
 * count onto the user row, and one of them will not fold: `listed` and `owned`
 * are two different filters over the SAME `items` relation, and a Prisma
 * `_count` select takes one filter per relation. A status groupBy answers both
 * in one query; the alternative was two filtered counts, which is worse.
 *
 *   1  user row, with the single-filter counts nested
 *   2  item status groupBy (listed / owned)
 *   3  items page
 *   4  completed trades with categories, for impact
 *   5  reviews received
 *   6  task completions
 *
 * NOTE the absence of a pickup-access query. These are the viewer's OWN items,
 * and resolvePickup() grants the owner precise access without consulting
 * anything — so the lookup every other item route needs is genuinely free here,
 * not merely skipped.
 *
 * Tasks are READ here, never awarded. Awarding is event-driven; GET /api/tasks
 * remains the reconcile path and is not duplicated.
