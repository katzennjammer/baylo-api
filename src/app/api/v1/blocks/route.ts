/**
 * GET  /api/v1/blocks — the caller's blocked-users list (settings screen).
 * POST /api/v1/blocks — block someone.
 *
 * Unblocking is DELETE /api/v1/blocks/[id], where [id] is the BLOCKED USER's
 * id, not the Block row's id. A caller who wants to unblock somebody has their
 * user id in hand — it is what the list above returns and what the profile
 * screen already knows — and making them first look up a join-row id is an
 * extra round trip for nothing.
 *
 * WHAT BLOCKING DOES NOT DO is the interesting part of this endpoint, and the
 * response says so explicitly rather than leaving the user to find out. See the
 * long note above blockConsequences() in @/lib/blocking: an active trade is not
 * cancelled and a bridging fee in escrow is not released, because blocking
 * your creditor must not be how you clear a debt.
