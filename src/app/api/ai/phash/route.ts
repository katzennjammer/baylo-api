// listing was traded it became OWNED or TRADED, left the pool, and its photo
// was free for anyone to post again with no warning. The check was strongest
// for listings nobody had wanted yet and silent for the ones that had actually
// changed hands — exactly backwards, since a stranger reusing the photo of an
// item that has already been traded away is the strongest signal there is.
//
// Measured on the live table when this was found: every identical-image pair
// but one had at least one side out of the pool. Two of three real images,
// re-uploaded from a second account, published unchallenged; with the filter
// gone all three match at Hamming distance 0.
//
// NOTHING IS EXCLUDED, INCLUDING TAKEDOWNS. Two different things hide a
// listing: `status = REMOVED`, which its OWNER sets and can undo via
// /api/items/[id]/relist, and `moderationHiddenAt`, which a moderator sets and
// the owner cannot. Neither is consulted here. A photo a moderator took down is
// the last one that should quietly become re-postable by a stranger, and an
// owner who delisted their own item is not blocked by their own row either —
// Stage 1B runs first and answers "self", which is allowed.
//
// So the rule is simply "every image this app has accepted", and no status
// column is read at all.
