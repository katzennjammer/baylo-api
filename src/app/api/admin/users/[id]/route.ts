/**
 * POST /api/admin/users/[id] — suspend or unsuspend an account.
 *
 * WHAT A SUSPENSION DOES: sets User.suspendedAt (and optionally suspendedUntil).
 * resolveSession() refuses a suspended account, so every authenticated route in
 * the application stops working for them within the life of one request — not
 * within the 15-minute life of their access token, and not within the 30-day
 * life of a web cookie. Their listings also leave every feed, because
 * visibleItemWhere() excludes a suspended owner: an account that cannot sign in
 * cannot answer a message or turn up to a meetup, and leaving its listings
 * up sends people to a counterparty who is structurally unable to reply.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO. Exactly what blocking does not do, and for
 * the identical reason: it does not cancel their in-flight trades and it does
 * not release a bridging fee held on one. A suspension that cleared obligations
 * would make misbehaving the cheapest way to escape one, and this system does
 * not do reversals — the items changed hands in person. The obligation
 * stands, the deadline keeps running, and the sweep will still default them.
 *
 * NOTE THE ROLE FLOOR: ADMIN, not MODERATOR. Suspension is the heaviest button
 * on the surface and the only one that can silence another staff account, so it
 * sits one rung above hiding a listing.
 *
 * THERE IS NO `role` FIELD IN THE SCHEMA BELOW, AND THERE MUST NEVER BE. This
 * is the closest route in the codebase to a promotion endpoint, which makes it
 * the one somebody would add it to. See the note on User.role: an API that can
 * grant ADMIN is a privilege-escalation target, and promotion is manual SQL.
