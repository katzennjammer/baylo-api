/**
 * The admin hub surface.
 *
 *   GET  /api/admin/hubs — every hub, active and not, with listing counts.
 *   POST /api/admin/hubs — create one.
 *
 * THERE IS NO DELETE, HERE OR IN [id]. Deactivation is the only way a hub
 * leaves circulation, because a DELETE would take the ItemSafeZone rows with it
 * and every listing offered there would silently lose the only answer it had to
 * "where would we meet?". The database backs this up rather than trusting the
 * route: ItemSafeZone.hubId is ON DELETE RESTRICT, so the same rule holds for
 * somebody at a SQL prompt.
 *
 * WHY A HUB WRITE IS AUDITED AT ALL. Every other AdminAction row is about a
 * person or their content; these are about shared infrastructure. But a hub
 * coordinate that quietly moved 400 metres, with no record of who moved it, is
 * a worse failure than most takedowns — people navigate to these places, and
 * the first sign of trouble is two strangers standing in different car parks.
 * `reason` is required for the same reason it is everywhere else in this tree.
