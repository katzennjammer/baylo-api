/**
 * PATCH /api/admin/hubs/[id] — edit a hub, or turn it on and off.
 *
 * ONE route rather than /edit and /deactivate, matching
 * /api/admin/listings/[id]: the two halves write the same audit shape, take the
 * same required reason, and touch the same row. Two files would eventually hold
 * two ideas of what a hub is.
 *
 * WHAT DEACTIVATION DOES: sets isActive false. That is the whole mechanism, and
 * everything about the feature falls out of where that flag is read —
 *
 *   GET /api/v1/hubs            filters on it, so the hub leaves the picker and
 *                               nothing can newly select it.
 *   resolveHubIds()             refuses it as a NEW association but permits a
 *                               listing that already had it to keep it.
 *   item detail                 still returns it, with isActive false, so a
 *                               listing offered there says so and is flagged.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: touch ItemSafeZone. Not one row. A listing
 * whose meetup point closed keeps pointing at it — the client strikes it
 * through and the owner picks somewhere else when they next edit. Cascading the
 * deactivation into the join table would be a moderator action that silently
 * rewrites hundreds of other people's listings, and it is unrecoverable: there
 * is no record of which listings used to name the hub, so reactivating it
 * cannot put them back.
 *
 * There is no DELETE. See the note in ../route.ts, and the RESTRICT on the FK
 * that enforces it below the application.
