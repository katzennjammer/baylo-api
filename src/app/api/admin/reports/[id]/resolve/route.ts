/**
 * POST /api/admin/reports/[id]/resolve — close a report, or claim it.
 *
 * Three decisions, one endpoint, because they are the same act at different
 * stages and splitting them into three routes would triple the places the audit
 * row can be forgotten:
 *
 *   reviewing   claim it. Still live; still holds its openKey slot; audited.
 *   dismissed   no violation found. Reporter told.
 *   actioned    a violation was found and something was done about it.
 *
 * "ACTIONED" DOES NOT ITSELF DO ANYTHING. Marking a report actioned records a
 * judgement; hiding the listing or suspending the account are separate calls to
 * separate routes, each with their own audit row. That separation is deliberate:
 * a single "resolve and punish" button makes the audit log ambiguous about what
 * was actually done, and the queue is not the only way a moderator arrives at a
 * listing.
 *
 * `note` is REQUIRED on all three. It is both the audit row's `reason` and,
 * for the two terminal states, the text the reporter reads. One field for both
 * so a moderator cannot write a real reason into the audit and a bland
 * platitude to the reporter — the person affected reads the same sentence the
 * record keeps.
