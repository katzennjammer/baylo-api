/**
 * GET /api/admin/anomalies — the two signals this system already produces and
 * has never shown anyone.
 *
 * Both of these have been getting written to the database for weeks. Neither
 * has had a surface, which means neither has ever been READ, which means the
 * work of detecting them has so far bought nothing.
 *
 *   1  DPA DEFAULTS. DeferredContract.defaultedAt, stamped by the lazy deadline
 *      sweep and never cleared — not even when a defaulted contract is later
 *      paid off in full. Deliberately so: paying late settles the debt, not the
 *      record. So this list is "everyone who has ever missed a deadline", which
 *      is the list a moderator wants, and `stillOwing` separates the ones who
 *      made good afterwards from the ones who did not.
 *
 *   2  REPEAT-TRADE-PAIR FLAGS. TaskCompletion rows with task = VERIFIED_SWAP
 *      and leaves = 0. awardTask() writes one of those every time two users who
 *      have already traded inside NEW_PARTNER_WINDOW_DAYS trade again: the swap
 *      completes normally and pays nothing, because otherwise two accounts
 *      could pass the same two items back and forth and mint Leaves forever.
 *
 *      A zero row is not itself misconduct — friends trade repeatedly, and the
 *      faucet guard already did its job. It is a SIGNAL, and it is worth a
 *      human's eye at volume: one pair with eleven zero-award swaps in a
 *      fortnight is the shape of two accounts run by one person, and nothing
 *      else in this system would ever mention it.
 *
 * Read-only. Nothing here writes, nothing here acts, and there is no
 * "investigate" button — a moderator who wants to act does it through the
 * report queue or the user route, where the audit row gets written.
