 * can simply ask again. Taking an email address in the body instead would make
 * this an open relay for mailing arbitrary addresses and an account-existence
 * oracle on top; requiring a session removes both without asking anything extra
 * of the client.
 *
 * A real static segment, not the NextAuth catch-all — see the note in
 * ../verify-email/route.ts.
