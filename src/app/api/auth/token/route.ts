 * This is the native client's equivalent of the web Credentials provider, and
 * it checks the same bcrypt hash in the same User.password column. The web
 * login is unaffected and still goes through NextAuth.
 *
 * NOTE ON ROUTING: this file is a real static segment, so it takes precedence
 * over the `[...nextauth]` catch-all one level up. Were it not, every request
 * here would be swallowed by NextAuth and answered with 400 "Bad request." —
 * which looks exactly like a validation failure but means the route does not
 * exist. The distinguishing marker is the response body, not the status.
