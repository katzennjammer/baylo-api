/**
 * Redeems an email verification token.
 *
 * This is a REAL static segment, not something the NextAuth catch-all handles.
 * `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` matches every /api/auth/* path and
 * answers 400 for any action it does not recognise, so a verification route
 * that lived only inside it would look like a working endpoint returning a
 * confusing error. Next's router gives a static segment precedence over a
 * catch-all at the same level, which is why this file — and register,
 * forgot-password, token, refresh and revoke before it — resolve here instead.
 * The GET/POST exports below are what prove it: the catch-all's handlers are
 * never invoked for this path.
 *
 * Two transports, one code path:
 *   GET  ?token=…  the link in the email, opened in a browser.
 *   POST { token } the native client, which cannot follow a web link cleanly —
 *                  it captures the token from a deep link or a paste and sends
 *                  it as JSON.
 * Both call consumeVerificationToken(), so there is exactly one place where a
 * token is validated and spent.
