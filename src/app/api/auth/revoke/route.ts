 * POST /api/auth/revoke — logout.
 *
 * Revokes the presented token's entire family, not just that one token. A
 * family is one login on one device, and its later tokens are rotations of the
 * same session; revoking only the token in hand would leave any un-rotated
 * sibling alive and the "logout" would not have logged anything out.
 *
 * Always answers 200, including for a token that does not exist or is already
 * revoked. Logout is idempotent, and reporting which tokens are real would make
 * this endpoint a free validity oracle for anyone holding a stolen string.
