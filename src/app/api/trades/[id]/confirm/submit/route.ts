    // the bcrypt compare that can burn one of the partner's guesses, and before
    // the code is marked used. That ordering is the whole point of doing it up
    // here rather than beside the write:
    //
    //   A malformed claim is a bad REQUEST, and a bad request must cost the
    //   caller nothing. Validated next to the write, a correct code paired with
    //   a bad hub id returned 400 *after* the code had already been consumed --
    //   the caller saw an error for an action that had partly happened, which
    //   is the shape that turns one confusing 400 into a support ticket.
    //
    // The claim is a FOREIGN KEY, not a boolean, and it is only accepted if
    // BOTH traded listings were already publicly offered at that hub.
    //
    // TO BE PLAIN ABOUT WHAT THIS IS: pre-committed self-attestation, NOT
    // verification. Nothing here observes the world -- somebody who wants the
    // Leaves without making the trip sends the same request as somebody who
    // made it. What the check buys is that the claim was pre-committed and
    // mutual: both owners named this hub on their listings, independently,
    // before this trade existed, and the counterparty could see it at offer
    // time. The lie has to be set up in advance, by two people, in public. See
    // resolveMeetupHub() for why GPS was considered and rejected.
    //
    // The deprecated boolean is REFUSED rather than ignored. A shipped client

     * ── THE CLAIM, AND THE ONE PLACE THE PLAN IS ALLOWED TO BECOME ONE ───────
     *
     * The explicit claim was validated before any mutation happened (see above);
     * this is only the write, and it runs after the code has been verified so
     * that a failed confirmation cannot record a meetup that was never
     * confirmed.
     *
     * WHEN THE CALLER NAMES NO HUB, AN AGREED PLAN STANDS IN FOR ONE. Two people
     * who arranged Parkmall, both said yes to it, travelled there and have now
     * exchanged codes in person should not be asked a second time where they
     * are. This is the only code path that copies `meetupHubId` into
     * `safeZoneHubId`, and every condition on it matters:
     *
     *   `meetupAgreedAt` MUST BE SET. A standing proposal is ONE person's
     *   suggestion. Treating it as a claim would let somebody mint the 10-Leaf
     *   SAFEZONE_MEETUP award by proposing a hub the other party never answered
     *   — the exact conflation keeping these two columns apart exists to
     *   prevent. An unanswered plan claims nothing.
     *
     *   THE CODES HAVE ALREADY MATCHED. We are past the bcrypt compare, so the
     *   two of them are demonstrably together. The plan is not evidence; the
     *   codes are, and the plan only supplies the place name.
     *
     *   AN EXPLICIT `safeZoneHubId` STILL WINS. Plans change on the day and the
     *   parties are the authority on where they actually ended up.
     *
     *   A PLAN THAT NO LONGER VALIDATES IS DROPPED, NOT FATAL. Either listing
     *   may have stopped naming that hub since the plan was agreed. The caller
     *   did not ask for this claim, so a stale one costs them their award and
     *   nothing else — failing the whole confirmation over it would strand two
     *   people who just swapped in person.
