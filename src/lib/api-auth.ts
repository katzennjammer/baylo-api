/**
 * The single authentication entry point for every authenticated API route.
 *
 * Two clients, two credentials, one resolver:
 *   - the native client sends `Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>`;
 *   - the web admin side sends its existing NextAuth session cookie.
 * Both come back as the same shape, so a route never knows or cares which one
 * it got. NextAuth is not being replaced — the cookie path below IS the web
 * app's login, unchanged.
 *
 * TWO ACCOUNT STATES ARE REFUSED HERE, both by returning null:
 *   deleted    (deletedAt)   -- the account is gone; see the note on the column.
 *   suspended  (suspendedAt) -- a moderator has stopped this account acting.
 *
 * Suspension is checked in this one place, and that is what makes it real. The
 * alternative -- a gate each write route opts into -- is a gate the next route
 * somebody adds will not have, and the whole point of a suspension is that it
 * covers everything at once. Cost of putting it here: a suspended user's client
 * sees 401s, which reads as "signed out" rather than "suspended". The auth
 * endpoints say the actual reason (see /api/auth/token), so the user finds out
 * the moment they try to sign in again rather than being left guessing.
 *
 * Precedence rule, and it is a security decision rather than a stylistic one:
 * a Bearer header that is PRESENT but invalid returns null. It does NOT fall
 * through to the cookie. Falling through would mean a native client whose
 * access token had expired silently kept working off a stale cookie, and an
 * expired token would be indistinguishable from a live one — the 15-minute
 * expiry would stop meaning anything. Absence of the header is what selects the
 * cookie path; a failed Bearer is a failed request.

 *
 * Same shape as enforceInitiateTrade() in @/lib/reputation-gate -- a `response`
 * that is either a ready-to-return NextResponse or null, and on the null branch
 * the thing the handler needs next. Here that is the actor, because every admin
 * action writes an audit row naming who did it:
 *
 *   const gate = await requireRole("ADMIN")
 *   if (gate.response) return gate.response
 *   // gate.actor.id
 *
 * WHY 403 AND NOT 404. Everywhere else in this codebase "you may not see this"
 * answers 404, deliberately, because a 403 confirms the row exists -- see the
 * note on notFound() in @/lib/v1/envelope. The /api/admin tree is the one place
 * that rule is inverted, and for a reason: there is no row here whose existence
 * is a secret. /api/admin/reports is a fixed URL that anyone can read out of the
 * app bundle, so hiding it protects nothing, while a 403 tells an honest
 * signed-in user the truth ("this is staff-only") instead of a lie.
 *
 * THE ROLE IS RE-READ FROM THE DATABASE ON EVERY CALL, never taken from the
 * session token. A NextAuth JWT here lives 30 days; a role revoked on Tuesday
 * must stop working on Tuesday, not whenever the token happens to expire.
 *
 * There is deliberately no counterpart that WRITES `role`. See the note on the
 * column: promotion is a manual SQL statement, because an endpoint that grants
 * ADMIN is a privilege-escalation target and there is no reason for one to exist.
