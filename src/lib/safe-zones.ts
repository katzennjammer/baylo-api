/**
 * Safe-Zone Hubs — curated public meetup locations.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL, stated once here so no route has to restate it: the
 * obvious way to answer "where would we meet?" is to plot Item.pickupLat /
 * pickupLng on a map, and that publishes an approximate home address for every
 * seller who offers local pickup. Coarsening the pin does not fix it — a ~1 km
 * circle around a listing re-posted weekly from the same house resolves to that
 * house after a few observations. resolvePickup() in @/lib/item-visibility
 * already treats those columns as the seller's front door; a map would hand
 * them to everyone.
 *
 * A hub is a different kind of object. Nobody lives at a mall information desk.
 *
 * WHICH IS WHY HUB COORDINATES ARE PUBLIC AND PRECISE, and the single rule this
 * module enforces by convention is that they stay that way:
 *
 *   NEVER pass a hub latitude/longitude through coarsen().
 *
 * That function is a rule about sellers' homes. Applied to a hub it produces a
 * point somewhere in the general vicinity of the mall — useless to two people
 * trying to find each other, and protecting nobody. If you reach for it here,
 * the reach is the bug.
 *
 * The other half of the rule runs the other way and is enforced by code rather
 * than convention: NOTHING in the hub endpoints touches the pickup columns.
 * v1Hub() is constructed field by field from SAFE_ZONE_HUB_SELECT, and the item
 * shapes those endpoints emit go through the same v1Item() every other route
 * uses, so the hub coordinate is the only location that reaches a map.

 * renders a marker in the Atlantic and sends two strangers to coordinates
 * neither of them chose — the exact failure the module note says a moved hub is
 * worse for, except nobody moved this one and the audit has nothing to show.
 *
 * WHY HERE AND NOT ONLY IN THE FORM. The admin page is one caller. The route is
 * the contract, and it can be reached by a curl, a script or a future client
 * that never renders HubForm at all. A guard only the happy-path UI observes is
 * not a guard, it is a habit — so the rule lives next to the data it protects
 * and both POST and PATCH apply it.
 *
 * WHY NOT A GEOGRAPHIC BOX: see the createSchema note in the route. Range
 * checking is validation; (0, 0) is not caught by a range, it is caught by
 * knowing what the point means. The check is deliberately exact — `0°N, 0°E` is
 * the sentinel, and a coordinate pair one ten-thousandth of a degree off it is a

 * if that constraint were ever relaxed — writes a row pointing at nothing, and
 * the listing then claims a meeting place that does not exist. One SELECT
 * settles the whole array.
 *
 * THE ACTIVE RULE IS ASYMMETRIC, and this is the part worth reading:
 *
 *   A hub ALREADY associated with this listing may be kept even after it has
 *   been deactivated. A hub NOT already associated must be active to be added.
 *
 * The symmetric version — "only active hubs, full stop" — looks tidier and is
 * wrong. Clients round-trip the whole hub array on every edit, so the moment a
 * hub is deactivated every listing offered at it becomes uneditable: changing
 * the title 400s because the array still contains the closed mall, and the
 * owner's only way out is to notice and drop it. That is deactivation breaking
 * existing associations through the back door, which is the one thing this
 * feature is not allowed to do.
 *
 * `currentHubIds` is what makes the distinction available. Omitting it — the
 * create path, where there is nothing to retain — means every id must be
 * active, which is the fail-safe direction and matches how a forgotten
 * `tradeAccessIds` is treated as "no access" rather than "all access".

 * Validates a claimed meetup hub against the two listings in a trade.
 *
 * THE RULE: the hub must be one that BOTH traded listings were already offered
 * at. Not either — both.
 *
 * THIS IS PRE-COMMITTED SELF-ATTESTATION, AND IT IS NOT VERIFICATION. Saying so
 * here, next to the code, because a foreign key and a validation function
 * together look like proof and are not:
 *
 *   NOT established — that these two people were at this place. Nothing in this
 *   system observes the physical world. A participant who wants the Leaves
 *   without making the trip sends byte-for-byte the same request as one who
 *   made it. No amount of checking on this side of the wire changes that.
 *
 *   Established — the claim is PRE-COMMITTED and MUTUAL. Both owners had to
 *   name this hub on their listing publicly and independently, before this
 *   trade existed, and the counterparty could see it when they made the offer.
 *   A false claim therefore has to be arranged in advance, by two people, in
 *   public, instead of ticked at the end by one of them. That is a real
 *   increase in the cost and the visibility of the lie. It is not proof, and
 *   the reward's honest description is "you both said in advance you would meet
 *   here, and afterwards you both said you did".
 *
 * The alternative that WOULD be verification — a GPS fix near the hub at
 * confirmation time — was considered and rejected: a client coordinate is
 * spoofable from a developer-options toggle, so without device attestation it
 * is a more elaborate checkbox, and every seeded landmark is indoors or under a
 * roof where GPS drifts 50-200 m. An honest-user-safe radius in a dense
 * commercial strip would cover several other hubs. A check that fails honest
 * users without stopping dishonest ones is worse than no check and a truthful
 * comment.
 *
 * ON isActive: a hub deactivated AFTER both listings named it still satisfies
 * this. The pre-commitment was made while it was open, the parties have already
 * met, and refusing the award afterwards would penalise them for an
 * administrative decision taken in between. Same asymmetry resolveHubIds()
 * applies, for the same reason.
