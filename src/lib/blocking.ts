/**
 * Block enforcement, in the QUERY LAYER.
 *
 * The rule this module exists to make structural: BLOCKED CONTENT NEVER REACHES
 * THE CLIENT. Not "reaches it and is filtered", not "reaches it with a flag the
 * client is asked to honour" — never leaves the database. Post-fetch filtering
 * fails three ways that a WHERE clause does not:
 *
 *   - it puts the blocked user's rows on the wire, where a client bug, a proxy
 *     log or a devtools panel is enough to undo the block;
 *   - it silently shortens pages (fetch 20, filter 3, show 17), so pagination
 *     drifts and "load more" eventually returns an empty page that is not the
 *     end of the list;
 *   - it is opt-in per call site, so the next screen someone writes is
 *     unfiltered by default.
 *
 * BOTH DIRECTIONS, ALWAYS. A block is one row (see the Block model), and every
 * check below asks two questions of it: have I blocked them, and have they
 * blocked me. Either answer hides the content. Enforcing one direction only
 * would mean a harasser keeps seeing the person who blocked them, which is
 * backwards — the person who blocked is the one being protected.

// ── What a block deliberately does NOT do ────────────────────────────────────

/**
 * The trades that survive a block, for the confirmation the
 * blocker is shown.
 *
 * BLOCKING MID-TRADE DOES NOT CANCEL THE TRADE, AND BLOCKING A CREDITOR DOES
 * NOT VOID THE DEBT. Both are reversals, and this system does not do reversals:
 * a swap that has already happened cannot be un-happened; see the note on
 * an item back, because the item changed hands at a meetup and no software here
 * can recover it.
 *
 * The concrete failure being avoided is not hypothetical. If a block cancelled
 * an active trade, then blocking would be a unilateral undo button for a deal
 * the other party has already handed over goods for. If a block voided a
 * deferred agreement, blocking your creditor would have been how you cleared
 * a debt — one tap, and a contract the tier system, the deadline sweep and the
 * default record are all built around evaporates. Every debtor would find that
 * within a week.
 *
 * So the line is drawn at NEW EXPOSURE, not existing obligation:
 *
 *   REFUSED after a block   messaging, new trade requests, new offers, seeing
 *                           each other's listings — everything that starts
 *                           something.
 *   UNCHANGED after a block the trade's own state machine (accept, confirm,
 *                           complete, cancel), the bridging fee still in
 *                           escrow on it,
 *                           extension, sweep, default and auto-payment.
 *
 * Which leaves one honest rough edge, named here rather than discovered later:
 * two people mid-handover who can no longer message each other. That is the
 * blocker's own choice and it is recoverable — the in-person confirmation codes
 * do not need chat, either party may still cancel the trade, and unblocking
 * restores messaging — so it is a worse experience for the blocker, not a trap.
 * The alternative, letting a block be selectively porous "just for this trade",
 * reopens exactly the channel someone blocked to close.
 *
 * This function exists so the block route can SAY all that at the moment it
 * matters, with the actual trade in front of the user.
