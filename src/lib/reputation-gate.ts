/**
 * Server-side enforcement of the reputation tiers.
 *
 * Until now getTrustTier() was a badge. It coloured a chip on a profile and
 * restricted nothing, which meant every "limit" the product described was
 * really a suggestion that a client could decline to follow. This module is
 * where the tiers stop being decoration.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE EXISTS FOR: a hidden button is not a control. Every check
 * below runs in a route handler, against the database, after the request has
 * been authenticated — never in a component, never as a `disabled` prop, never
 * as a field the client is trusted to echo back. The UI may absolutely hide the
 * button as well; that is a courtesy to the user, not a security boundary, and
 * removing it must change nothing about what the server permits.
 *
 * Each `enforce*` returns a ready-to-return NextResponse, or null to proceed —
 * the same shape as enforceRateLimit(), so a handler reads the same way whether
 * it is being limited by rate or by reputation.

/**
 * Blocks a user with a standing default from STARTING a trade.
 *
 * Read the asymmetry carefully, because getting it wrong produces a deadlock
 * that no amount of good behaviour escapes:
 *
 *   BLOCKED   proposing a trade, making an offer — anything where the defaulter
 *             reaches for someone else's item and takes on more exposure.
 *   ALLOWED   accepting a trade or an offer, and listing items.
 *
 * Trading is the only way to earn Leaves in this economy. A blanket ban would
 * mean a defaulter can never earn the Leaves that would clear the default that
 * caused the ban — permanently restricted, with no move available that improves
 * their position. So the accept path is deliberately left open, and listing is
 * left open too, because a defaulter with no listings would have nothing for
 * anyone to make them an offer on and the open accept path would be theatre.
 *
 * The path out is concrete: list, receive an offer, accept it, complete the
 * swap. Both the Leaves received and the VERIFIED_SWAP task reward land in the
 * debtor's balance, applyEarningsToContracts() sweeps them straight to the
 * creditor, and when the last Leaf lands the contract goes FULFILLED and this
 * function stops returning a 403.
 *
 * Note also what the defaulter CANNOT do through the open accept path: spend.
 * On both the offer and the trade paths it is the initiator who pledges Leaves,
 * so a blocked initiator is already a blocked spender, and the accept path can
 * only bring Leaves in.

 * Applies on BOTH the initiate and accept paths, unlike the default

 * started the conversation, and a cap that only bound initiators would be
 * avoided by asking the other party to send the offer.
 *
 * An item with a NULL valueLeaves passes. That is a real hole and worth naming:
 * valueLeaves is optional on Item and one live listing has none, so an unvalued
 * listing is currently uncapped. Refusing every unvalued item instead would
 * block ordinary trading on listings that predate valuation, which is a bigger
