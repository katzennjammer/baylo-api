// ── Task reward system ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Tasks award Pasa Leaves. Every award writes a LeafTransaction row of type
// TASK_REWARD, so a user's balance is always reconstructable from the ledger.
//
// Two balances, two jobs:
//   User.leaves         — spendable, moves on trades and settlement.
//   User.lifetimeLeaves — monotonic, only ever incremented by a positive award.
//                         Ranks, badges and profile display key off this, so a
//                         user never loses rank by spending what they earned.
//
// VERIFIED_SWAP and SAFEZONE_MEETUP are repeatable (once per trade); the rest
// are one-time. Faucet limits live here too — see WEEKLY_TASK_LEAF_CAP and
// NEW_PARTNER_WINDOW_DAYS.

// ── Faucet limits ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

// Maximum Leaves a user can earn from tasks in any rolling 7-day window.
// Enforced server-side by summing that user's positive TASK_REWARD ledger rows
// over the 7 days before the awarding event — the event's own week, not the
// week the award happens to be processed in. An award refused by the cap is
// refused permanently, since a past week can never drop back under it.
// The signup grant is NOT counted against this cap — it is one-time and
// separately gated.
export const WEEKLY_TASK_LEAF_CAP = 100

// BOTH REPEATABLE TASKS — VERIFIED_SWAP and SAFEZONE_MEETUP — award only when
// the counterparty is someone the user has not completed a trade with inside
// this window. Repeat trades with the same partner still complete normally,
// they just award nothing; otherwise two users could swap the same two items
// back and forth and mint Leaves forever.
//
// SAFEZONE_MEETUP was outside this rule until 28 Aug 2026, which left exactly
// the faucet the rule exists to prevent: a colluding pair collected 10 Leaves
// each per trade, capped only by WEEKLY_TASK_LEAF_CAP, i.e. 100 Leaves each per
// week indefinitely — Guardian rank (300 lifetime) in three weeks. It had never
// actually been awarded on this database when the gap was found, so no Leaves
// were minted through it and nothing was clawed back. The enforcing set is
// PARTNER_GATED in @/lib/tasks; add every future repeatable task to it.
export const NEW_PARTNER_WINDOW_DAYS = 30

// One-time grant given at account verification — NOT at registration. That
// distinction is the entire safety property: an ungated grant at signup lets an
// attacker mint Leaves by mass-creating accounts, so the grant is gated behind
// proving control of a Google account (and later a phone number).
//
// Separately gated (User.signupGrantClaimed, one per account) and exempt from
// WEEKLY_TASK_LEAF_CAP — the exemption falls out of it being written as a
// SIGNUP_GRANT ledger row rather than a TASK_REWARD one, which is what the cap
// sums. Paid by markVerified(); see @/lib/verification.
//
// 50 → 20 on 11 Sep 2026. Note that a verifying user never sees this number on
// its own: markVerified() pays the grant AND the VERIFY_ACCOUNT task in the
// same call, so the figure that lands in their balance is
// VERIFY_CREDIT_LEAVES below (30 today). Copy that names what verifying is
// worth must quote THAT, not this — see the mailer and the mobile client.
