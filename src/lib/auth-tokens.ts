/**
 * Token auth for the native (React Native) client.
 *
 * The web admin side is untouched: it keeps its NextAuth cookie session and
 * never issues or presents one of these. Both paths meet at resolveSession()
 * in `@/lib/api-auth`, which is what every authenticated route calls.
 *
 * Two different kinds of token, deliberately built differently:
 *
 *   ACCESS  — a short-lived (15 min) HS256 JWT. Stateless: no database row, no
 *             revocation list. That is the trade being made — a stolen access
 *             token stays valid until it expires, which is why it expires fast
 *             and why the payload carries a user id and its refresh family
 *             (`sid`) and nothing else. The one database read it does get is
 *             "is that family still signed in" (see resolveSession).
 *
 *   REFRESH — a 30-day opaque random string. NOT a JWT: there is nothing to
 *             read in it, and it is worthless to anyone who reads the database,
 *             because only its SHA-256 is stored. It is single-use and rotates
 *             on every refresh, so a stolen one can be detected the moment
 *             either party tries to use a token the other already spent.
