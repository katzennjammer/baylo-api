/**
 * The valuation model. One file, no network calls, no model inference.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Baylo's listing valuation is a STATISTICAL model, not a language model. The
 * only AI in the listing flow is /api/ai/identify, which reads a photo and
 * returns a category and a condition. Those two labels are the input here; the
 * number comes out of the tables below and nothing else.
 *
 * That split is deliberate and it is the defensible one. An LLM asked to price
 * "black iPhone, screen cracked" can answer 1,800 Leaves on one call and 2,300
 * on the next — same prompt, same item, different number, because sampling is
 * stochastic. A marketplace cannot tell a user their listing is worth X and
 * then tell the next user the identical item is worth Y. Everything below is
 * pure arithmetic over fixed constants and stored rows: same inputs, same
 * output, every time, and every number traceable to a named constant or a real
 * settled trade.
 *
 * THE TWO PATHS
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A valuation resolves by one of exactly two paths, and which one ran is
 * recorded on the Item as `valuationSource`:
 *
 *   "comparables"     >= MIN_COMPARABLES settled Baylo items in this category
 *                     carried a price. The suggestion is derived from them.
 *   "category_band"   fewer than that. The suggestion comes from CATEGORY_BANDS.
 *
 * There is no third path and no silent fallback inside a path: valueItem()
 * always reports which of the two produced the number it returned.
