 * one, and neither the label nor the hashtag lives in two places. Today the
 * labels are duplicated across ai/value/route.ts, the trending route and
 * several dashboard pages, and they have already drifted: CLOTHING is
 * "Clothing" in one and "#Fashion" in another.
 *
 * These tables are the v1 source of truth. The existing routes keep their own
 * copies until the web user-side routes retire — deduplicating them now would
 * mean editing live routes for a cosmetic win.
