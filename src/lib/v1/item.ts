 * Defined once so those screens cannot drift apart the way the current web
 * pages have — tradeplace and listings/[id] already map their own rows their own
 * ways and disagree about which owner fields exist.
 *
 * Two deliberate differences from the web's shapeItem():
 *
 *   - The object is CONSTRUCTED FIELD BY FIELD, never spread from the row.
 *     shapeItem() spreads and then deletes the three pickup columns, which is
 *     safe only for the columns someone remembered to delete: it is why
 *     `wantedItems` still ships alongside its own replacement, and it is the
 *     same pattern that leaked pickup coordinates in the first place. A column
 *     added to Item tomorrow reaches no client through this function.
 *
 *   - `wantedItems` is gone (D3). The free text survives as `wanted`; the raw
 *     column name does not appear. The live /api/items contract is untouched —
 *     removing it there is its own change.
 *
 * Pickup still goes through resolvePickup(), the shared rule, so precise
 * coordinates reach only the owner and an accepted counterparty.
