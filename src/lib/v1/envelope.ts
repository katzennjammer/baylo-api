 * point: the existing routes return a bare object on success and
 * `{ error: string }` on failure, so a caller has to know each route's two
 * shapes. Here it knows one.
 *
 * `meta` carries pagination and anything else about the response rather than in
 * it — nextCursor, the filters actually applied. It is always present, `{}` when
 * there is nothing to say.
