 * Email verification for credentials signup.
 *
 * Until this existed, `markVerified()` had exactly two callers, both Google, so
 * an account created with an email and a password could never become verified —
 * and the signup grant, which is gated on verification, was unreachable
 * for it. This module is the third caller, and it deliberately adds nothing to
 * what verification *means*: it proves control of the mailbox and then hands off
 * to the same function Google sign-in uses. The award, the grant, the ledger
 * rows and the idempotency all come from there, unchanged.
 *
 * The token follows the RefreshToken rules rather than PasswordResetToken's:
 *   - 32 CSPRNG bytes, hex-encoded;
 *   - stored only as a SHA-256 digest, so the table holds nothing usable;
 *   - 24-hour expiry, checked on redemption;
 *   - single use, enforced by a conditional DELETE (see consumeVerificationToken);
 *   - one live token per user — issuing purges the previous one.
