 *
 * ── THIS FUNCTION DOES NOT SWEEP, AND THE CALLER MUST ───────────────────────
 *
 * "Still PENDING" is a status, and an offer past its three-day window is only
 * EXPIRED once something has moved it. `expireStaleOffers()` in @/lib/offers is
 * what moves it, and every path that reads this figure calls it FIRST — POST
 * /api/offers, PATCH /api/offers/[id], GET /api/v1/trades, GET /api/leaves and
 * the withdraw route all do.
 *
 * It is not called from in here on purpose. This function takes a narrow `LeafDb`
 * so it can run against a transaction client, and a sweep that wrote from inside
 * somebody else's transaction would widen the blast radius of any rollback to
 * include offers that had nothing to do with it. The cost is that a new caller
 * has to remember; this note is where they will look.
 *
 * Both the "make an offer" path and the "accept an offer" path must go through
 * this, otherwise a user can pledge the same leaves to several open offers and
 * over-commit. When re-checking an existing offer, pass its id as
 * `excludeOfferId` so the offer under review is not counted against itself.
