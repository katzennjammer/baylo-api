/**
 * Who is allowed to see an item's exact pickup point, and what everyone else
 * gets instead.
 *
 * The rule, stated once here so no route has to restate it: full-precision
 * coordinates and the reverse-geocoded postal address are the seller's home. A
 * marketplace listing is public; the seller's front door is not. Precise pickup
 * therefore goes to exactly two kinds of viewer —
 *
 *   - the item's owner, and
 *   - a counterparty who has been ACCEPTED into a trade for that item,
 *
 * and to nobody else. Everyone else sees `lat`/`lng` rounded to 2 decimal
 * places and no address at all.
 *
 * 2 dp is ~1.1 km of latitude, which is enough to answer "is this near me?" —
 * the only question a browsing user needs answered — and not enough to pick a
 * building. Rounding is done here, on the server, before the number reaches a
 * response body. Sending exact coordinates with a "display coarsely" flag would
 * put the real value on the wire, where a client is free to ignore the flag.
