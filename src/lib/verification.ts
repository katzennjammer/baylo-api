/**
 * The one place an account becomes verified.
 *
 * `User.isVerified` is the whole definition of "verified". It replaced the old
 * `password === null` test, which really meant "signed up with Google and never
 * set a password" — an authentication detail standing in for a trust decision,
 * with no room for any second verification route.
 *
 * Every way of verifying funnels through here: the web Google callback, the
 * native Google token exchange, and the emailed verification link. A new route
 * only has to call markVerified() — the award and the grant come with it, and
 * no logic downstream of this function needs to change.
 *
 * IT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT-ID CHECK, and nothing here should ever be made to
 * do double duty as one. That gate lives in @/lib/id-verification, is derived
 * from IdVerification rows rather than from a flag, awards no Leaves, and
 * governs two acts this flag governs neither of. A phone-OTP route was once
 * planned as a third caller of this function; it was replaced by the ID check,
 * which is deliberately NOT plumbed through here.
 *
 * Three things happen when the flag flips, and they are deliberately separate
 * from each other:
 *
 *   1. isVerified false -> true.
 *   2. VERIFY_ACCOUNT, through the normal awardTask path — ledger row, both
 *      balances, subject to the weekly cap like any other task.
 *   3. The one-time signup grant, which is NOT a task: separately gated on
 *      signupGrantClaimed and exempt from the weekly cap.
 *
 * Idempotent by construction. Every step is individually guarded, so calling
 * this on an already-verified account is a no-op that credits nothing — 2 by
 * the TaskCompletion unique constraint, 3 by the signupGrantClaimed flag.

 * and matches nothing. Only the update that reports count === 1 writes a ledger
 * row, so a double credit is not merely unlikely — it cannot be expressed.
